## Sprint Plan

### Sprint 1 — Foundation ✅ Complete (T1–T4)

App scaffold, Prisma schema, NextAuth magic-link, multi-role support, onboarding branch.

### Sprint 2 — Creator Side (T5–T11) ✅ Complete (except T10 tags UI)

Goal: a creator can sign up, complete their profile, upload artworks, publish a release, and share their public link.

- **T5** ✅ `/creator/setup` multi-step form: display name, slug (unique check), avatar upload, bio, payout basics. Gate publish on required fields.
- **T6** ✅ `/creator/profile` social links: repeatable label + URL list (add/remove).
- **T7** ✅ File upload infrastructure: storage adapter (local dev / S3-compatible prod), upload API route `/api/uploads`.
- **T8** ✅ `/creator/artworks` CRUD: upload, title, orientation capture, archive.
- **T9** ✅ `/creator/releases` + `/creator/releases/new` + `/creator/releases/[id]`: create release, assign artworks, set publish state.
- **T10** 🟡 Release tags: tag model in schema, but UI for tag selector/display not implemented.
- **T11** ✅ `/creators/[slug]` public profile: display name, avatar, bio, social links, published releases, subscribe CTA.

### Sprint 3 — Collector Side (T12–T15) ⬜ Not started

Goal: a collector can land on a creator link, sign up, subscribe, select releases, and browse.

- **T12** ⬜ `/creators/[slug]/subscribe` + `/collector/setup`: post-auth onboarding, shipping country capture. (Placeholders only)
- **T13** ⬜ Collector creator subscription record creation + `/collector/subscriptions` view. (Placeholder only)
- **T14** ⬜ `/collector/releases` release selection flow: browse creator releases, select/deselect for current cycle. (Placeholder only)
- **T15** ⬜ `/browse/creators` + `/browse/releases` + `/collector/discover`: filtered by tags, basic search. (Placeholders only)

**Note:** Schema models exist (`CollectorProfile`, `CollectorCreatorSubscription`, `CollectorReleaseSelection`) but no UI implementation yet.

### Sprint 4 — Platform Controls (T16–T19)

Goal: admin can manage cycles, constraints, and pricing; collector sees live quote estimate.

- **T16** `/admin/cycles`: create/edit `SubscriptionCycle` with lock + fulfillment dates, status transitions.
- **T17** `/admin/booklet-constraints`: configure min/max pages, active flag.
- **T18** Peecho integration: offering sync to `PodOffering`, quote endpoint wrapper at `/api/pricing/quote`.
- **T19** `/collector/pricing`: display live Peecho quote snapshot; persist to `PricingQuoteSnapshot`.

### Sprint 5 — Notifications + Fulfillment Gate (T20–T24)

Goal: automated emails keep creators and collectors on the happy path; fulfillment blocked when eligibility fails.

- **T20** Notification framework: Resend email templates for all `EmailNotificationType` values, trigger service.
- **T21** Pre-lock job: scan collector selections, detect insufficient eligible pages, trigger at-risk notifications.
- **T22** Fulfillment block: at lock date, mark ineligible collectors as blocked, send `COLLECTOR_FULFILLMENT_BLOCKED`.
- **T23** Stub interfaces: `BookletComposition`, `PodOrder`, `CreatorPayout` types as no-op boundaries for future phases.
- **T24** Integration QA: role gating on all protected routes, cycle date gating, quote fallback, notification log audit.

## Notes

- Prisma 7 with `@prisma/adapter-pg` (lazy client — no eager DB connection at build time) ✅
- NextAuth v5 beta: magic-link via Resend, roles in session, post-auth → `/onboarding` ✅
