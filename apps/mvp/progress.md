## Sprint Plan

### Sprint 1 — Foundation ✅ Complete (T1–T4)

App scaffold, Prisma schema, NextAuth magic-link, multi-role support, onboarding branch.

### Sprint 2 — Creator Side (T5–T11) ✅ Complete (except T10 tags UI)

Goal: a creator can sign up, complete their profile, upload artworks, publish a release, and share their public link.

- **T5** ✅ `/creator/setup` multi-step form: display name, slug (unique check), avatar upload, bio, payout basics. Gate publish on required fields.
- **T6** ✅ `/creator/profile` social links: repeatable label + URL list (add/remove).
- **T7** ✅ File upload infrastructure: storage adapter (local dev / S3-compatible prod), upload API route `/api/uploads`.
- **T8** ✅ `/creator/artworks` CRUD: upload, title, orientation capture, archive.
- **T9** ✅ `/creator/releases` + `/creator/releases/new` + `/creator/releases/[id]`: create release, assign artworks, set publish state.
- **T10** 🟡 Release tags: tag model in schema, but UI for tag selector/display not implemented.
- **T11** ✅ `/creators/[slug]` public profile: display name, avatar, bio, social links, published releases, subscribe CTA.

### Sprint 3 — Collector Side (T12–T15) ✅ Complete

Goal: a collector can land on a creator link, sign up, subscribe, select releases, and browse.

- **T12** ✅ `/creators/[slug]/subscribe` + `/collector/setup`: Full implementation with role creation, shipping country selection (24 countries), and redirect flow from creator profiles.
- **T13** ✅ `/collector/subscriptions`: Grid view of active subscriptions with creator cards, avatars, bio snippets, and links to creator profiles.
- **T14** ✅ `/collector/releases`: Interactive release selection grid with current cycle info, lock date display, artwork previews, tag filtering, and optimistic UI updates.
- **T15** ✅ `/browse/creators` + `/browse/releases` + `/collector/discover`: Full browse experience with tag filtering, creator/release cards, search by tags, and dual-view discover page.

**Implementation details:**

- New actions: `lib/actions/collector.ts` (profile, subscriptions, selections), `lib/actions/cycles.ts` (cycle queries), `lib/actions/browse.ts` (public discovery)
- New components: `CollectorSetupForm`, `ReleaseSelectionGrid`
- All pages fully functional with proper auth guards, empty states, and responsive layouts
- Tag-based filtering across all browse/discover pages
- Optimistic UI updates for release selection with error rollback
- Country list marked for Peecho integration in Sprint 4 (currently hardcoded 24 countries)
- Collector dashboard (`/collector`) with stats cards, subscription preview, and quick links
- Header navigation updated to match actual routes (`/browse/creators`, `/browse/releases`)

### Sprint 4 — Platform Controls (T16–T19)

Goal: admin can manage cycles, constraints, and pricing; collector sees live quote estimate.

- **T16** ⬜ `/admin/cycles`: create/edit `SubscriptionCycle` with lock + fulfillment dates, status transitions.
- **T17** ⬜ `/admin/booklet-constraints`: configure min/max pages, active flag.
- **T18** 🟡 Peecho API v3 client (`lib/peecho/client.ts` + `lib/peecho/quote-service.ts`):
  - `PeechoClient`: `getOfferings` (GET `/offering/list`), `getQuote` (POST `/quote`), `createOrder` (POST `/order/`), `payOrder` (POST `/order/payment/` with SHA-256 secret)
  - Auth: `PEECHO_MERCHANT_API_KEY` only (v2 `buttonKey` removed)
  - Response types match v3 API: `quotedItems[]`, numeric prices, nested `quoteDetails`
  - `quote-service.ts` maps to internal `ShippingQuoteResult` shape
  - 12 unit tests + 16/16 e2e sandbox tests passing (`pnpm test:peecho`)
  - **Remaining:** offering sync to `PodOffering` table, `/api/pricing/quote` route
- **T19** ⬜ `/collector/pricing`: display live Peecho quote snapshot; persist to `PricingQuoteSnapshot`.

### Sprint 5 — Notifications + Fulfillment Gate (T20–T24)

Goal: automated emails keep creators and collectors on the happy path; fulfillment blocked when eligibility fails.

- **T20** Notification framework: Resend email templates for all `EmailNotificationType` values, trigger service.
- **T21** Pre-lock job: scan collector selections, detect insufficient eligible pages, trigger at-risk notifications.
- **T22** Fulfillment block: at lock date, mark ineligible collectors as blocked, send `COLLECTOR_FULFILLMENT_BLOCKED`.
- **T23** Stub interfaces: `BookletComposition`, `PodOrder`, `CreatorPayout` types as no-op boundaries for future phases.
- **T24** Integration QA: role gating on all protected routes, cycle date gating, quote fallback, notification log audit.

## Notes

- Prisma 7 with `@prisma/adapter-pg` (lazy client — no eager DB connection at build time) ✅
- NextAuth v5 beta: magic-link via Resend, roles in session, post-auth → `/onboarding` ✅
